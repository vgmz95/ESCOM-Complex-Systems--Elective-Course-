# ESCOM Complex Systems (Elective Course)
This repository contains all the code made during the optative course of Complex systems at IPN - ESCOM, these programs were made entirely on Java and JavaFX.

## One dimensional automaton 
This program generates all 255 rules of the [elementary cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton#Random_initial_state), the initial array can be generated randomly, by typing it into the console or by reading a plain text archive.
